What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge involves integrating the updated changes from a local repo 
to the working directory. It ties together the history of both branches.
It preserves the structure of one feature branch and one main branch.

Rebase moves the entire feature branch to on top of the main branch, so while it also integrates
the features, it rewrites the project history by introducing a bunch of commit messages in the main branch
for each commit in the feature branch

What is a remote repository?

The remote repository is an online repository which multiple people 
have access to and it facilitates collaboration. It allows inidividuals 
to make their changes and have it reflect on this remote repositiory.
Following this other individuals will now have access to these changes 
while also having the ability to make their own changes.
